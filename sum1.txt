Within the first billion years of Earth's history, life appeared in the oceans and began to affect the Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation of anaerobic and, later, aerobic organisms. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets. Over 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct. In the history of life on Earth, biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass extinction events. The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water, mostly by oceans. The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation.
