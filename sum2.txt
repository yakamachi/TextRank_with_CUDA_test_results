Jobs is widely recognized as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor in 2003. In addition, he helped to develop the visual effects industry when he funded the computer graphics division of George Lucas's Lucasfilm in 1986. Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985 after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO John Sculley. The new company was Pixar, which produced the first 3D computer animated film Toy Story (1995).
