The results are evaluated using precision, recall, and F-measure. To avoid excessive growth of the graph size by adding all possible combinations of sequences consisting of more than one lexical unit (ngrams), we consider only single words as candidates for addition to the graph, with multi-word keywords being eventually reconstructed in the post-processing phase. The National Hurricane Center in Miami reported its position at 2 a.m. Sunday at latitude 16.1 north, longitude 67.5 west, about 140 miles south of Ponce, Puerto Rico, and 200 miles southeast of Santo Domingo. occurring words. After running the algorithm, a score is associated with each vertex, which represents the “importance” of the vertex within the graph. are also possible, and we are currently evaluating their impact on the summarization performance.
