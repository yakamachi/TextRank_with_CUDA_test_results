The Volta architecture introduces Independent Thread Scheduling which changes the way threads are scheduled on the GPU. The core language extensions have been introduced in Programming Model. It consists of a minimal set of extensions to the C++ language and a runtime library. Programming Interface CUDA C++ provides a simple path for users familiar with the C++ programming language to easily write programs for execution by the device. Applications using the driver API must compile code to separate files and explicitly load and execute the most appropriate file at runtime. Importing synchronization objects A Vulkan semaphore object exported using VK_EXTERNAL_SEMAPHORE_HANDLE_TYPE_OPAQUE_FD_BITcan be imported into CUDA using the file descriptor associated with that object as shown below.
