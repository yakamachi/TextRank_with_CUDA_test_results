As long as he didn’t leave spots of ink on the sheets, the Dursleys need never know that he was studying magic by night. The Dursley family of Number Four, Privet Drive, was the reason that Harry never enjoyed his summer holidays. On the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burning had no effect whatsoever. Ron Weasley, who was one of Harry’s best friends at Hogwarts, came from a whole family of wizards. Harry pushed his round glasses up the bridge of his nose, moved his flashlight closer to the book, and read: Non-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognizing it. For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year.
